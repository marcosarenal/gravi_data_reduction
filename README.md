## GRAVITY data reduction process: from raw data to science results

This tool intends to cover the full data reduction process and analysis of near-infrared K- band observations with the GRAVITY interferometer at Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI) at the Paranal Observatory.  These observations of Herbig Ae/Be stars provide with spatially and spectrally resolved data of their inner disks.
